		<h2>Top DJs</h2>
		<h1>Content :The magazine's biggest property is a list of the World's most popular DJs, called Top 100 DJs. The poll attracted over 1 million votes in 2015, making it the World's biggest music poll.[2]
Danny Rampling was the first winner named as the number one DJ in the world by the magazines journalists in 1991 this remained the format until 1993, [3] the magazine then introduced a Top 100 list that was still compiled by its staff until 1996. The decision was taken by the publication to let the readers of the magazine decide who they thought was the worlds top DJ and in 1997 English DJ Carl Cox was the first winner of the Top 100 DJs Award (public vote). Armin van Buuren currently holds the record of most overall wins with five and a record four consecutively.
The awards party for the poll was traditionally hosted at the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London. For the 2011 poll, the event was hosted outside of the UK for the first time in its history, being staged at the 2011's edition of the Amsterdam dance event. The 2012 and 2013 award shows were both held on 19 October at the same event.[4][5] Until 2002, the top three had consisted of at least one British DJ, since the same year at least one Dutch DJ has featured in the top three. In 2015 the Top 100 DJs Awards Party took place as the headline moment of the Amsterdam Music Festival. Over 40,000 guests witnessed the crowning of 2015's winner's Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.[2] Following the Amsterdam event, the winning DJs were flown to London, where they performed to a sold out Brixton Academy for the Top 100 DJs London show.
Top 100 DJs is considered to be hugely important to DJs as an influencer of booking fees and their current level of popularity. DJs regularly campaign for votes, a process which is allowed by the magazine.[6] Dutch DJ Hardwell once did a skydive as part of his campaign video;[7] David Guetta regularly creates animated videos as part of his voting campaign;[7] Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike released an exclusive mix to their fans as part of their 2015 campaign.[8] However due to the weight that is placed on Top 100 DJs ranking by bookers worldwide, there have been criticisms of the poll.</h1>
