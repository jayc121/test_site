<h2 id="1"> MARTIN GARRIX:</h2>	
<p class="hi">
The question rings out in the small alcove in which DJ Mag is perched next to Martin Garrix. The Dutch DJ and this year’s Top 100 winner pauses momentarily to reflect. “Trapped? No...” he replies, cautiously. “But I do feel a great sense of responsibility. I feel like I can't do stupid shit. I don't want to be a bad role model, I don't want to set a bad example. That’s very important to me.”

It’s a refreshingly grounded view from one of the globe’s most famous youngsters. Martin Garrix shot to stardom in 2013 thanks to his hit electronic track, ‘Animals’, that he produced aged 16 in his bedroom. ‘Animals’ has been viewed an unfathomable 900,000,000 times on YouTube, while Garrix has amassed a social media following bigger than the entire population of The Netherlands. That's 13 million Facebook likes, 8.1 million Instagram followers and 3.4 million Twitter fans — to be exact.

	<h2 id = "2">DIMITRI VEGAS & LIKE MIKE: </h2>
	<p class="hi">
		In the opening moments of last year’s annual Bringing The Madness show, which saw the brothers return to their home turf of Antwerp, Belgium for a spectacle-filled headline arena concert (this year’s upcoming shows have sold a whopping 80,000 tickets across four sold-out evenings, no less), Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike are shown striding dramatically towards the stage in slow motion.

As the arena is bombarded with flashing lights, and one of their unreleased jams ‘Action’ rings out over the speakers, the record’s drop is greeted with the requisite fireworks explosion. With older brother Dimitri settling in behind the decks, it isn’t long before hype-man Mike is reaching out to the crowd with a bottle of vodka in hand, urging them all to “drink it up”.

	<h2 id = "3">HARDWELL:</h2>
	<p class="hi">
	Still under 30 but already twice voted the best DJ in the world according to you lot, Hardwell has had another non-stop year in 2016. In demand by promoters on every continent, the last 12 months have seen him enjoy a great run of festival shows — playing everywhere from Ultra Music Festival in Miami to Creamfields to EDC Las Vegas to Flying Dutch Festival in his native Holland. 

He also made a big impact in Ibiza, with a third successive season as a resident at Ushuaïa. Almost single-handedly he has turned the White Isle onto big, glossy, main room dance sounds and has made the famous hotel and pool his own. “I love the vibe at Ushuaïa and the crowd are always wild, “ he says, before adding: “Same goes for Hakkasan in Las Vegas too. It’s one of my favourite clubs in the world to play, and one of the reasons I’m a resident there is because their booth is such a joy to DJ in.”

	<h2 id = "4">ARMIN VAN BUUREN:</h2>
	<p class="hi"> Perhaps Holland's most famous DJ export ever, it's tough to find something to write about Armin van Buuren that hasn't already been said. Winning the Top 100 a total of five (yes, five!) times, he's also been voted into the top five a record 14 years in a row, plus retaining his No.4 spot from last year in 2016. 

Aside from wracking up tens of thousands of votes in our annual poll, 2016 has seen the trance star continue his Armin Only: Embrace tour, which centres around original tracks, collaborations and remixes from his sixth studio album, 'Embrace'. A true showman, Armin has always been passionate about pushing boundaries with his big-budget stadium shows — this year he's focused on “involving more live elements, like the Toraiz SP16 drum machine, plus embracing sounds like the trumpet in my tracks”. </p>

	<h2 id = "5">TIËSTO:</h2>
	<p class="hi">
		There’s little that can be said about globe-trotting Dutch DJ Tiësto that hasn’t already been said. Career at the top table of trance. Check. Career at the top table of EDM. Check. 15 years at the top of the charts. Check. In that time, he’s also racked up a Grammy Award for his remix of John Legend’s ‘All Of Me’, performed at the Athens Olympics’ Opening Ceremony in 2004, and even has his own waxwork in Madame Tussauds. Now, having established himself as a fan favourite in India and Asia, it’s clear his sights on world domination know no bounds.

Speaking to DJ Mag in 2013, Tiësto – born Tijs Michiel Verwest – said: “As a lifelong fan of dance music, I’d want people to know me as a tireless worker who played some really tremendous landmark live shows and helped define modern dance music.” And there’s no arguing that that’s what he’s done. In 2001, his remix of Delirium’s ‘The Silence’ was the first house track ever broadcast on daytime radio in North America. Two years later, he also became the first DJ to sell out a stadium solo performance for over 25,000 people, both paving his own way as a chart-topping EDM superstar.

<section>
	<h2 id = "6">DAVID GUETTA:</h2>
	<p class="hi">David Guetta is a busy man. While this statement may not come as too much of a surprise, to give an idea of what we mean, just in the short space of time we’ve been attempting to pin him down for an interview for this very article, the Frenchman has been locked away in studio sessions in LA and playing gigs all across Europe — and this coming month he’s off to Brazil for a short tour too. That’s a lot of airmiles! In fact, according to one popular ticketing website, he’s played 108 gigs in 2016 already — that’s a lot of music!

The most notable of these, without a doubt, was Dave’s performance under the Eiffel Tower as part of the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament. After being announced as the official musical ambassador for the French-hosted event at the end of 2015, Guetta’s track ‘This One’s For You’, featuring vocals from Zara Larsson, was made the official song of tournament. He then performed the track at his home city’s most iconic site; with the tragic Paris terrorist attacks still fresh in everyone’s minds, this was a hugely significant moment for Guetta (and a proud one for the dance music industry as a whole).</p>

<section>
	<h2 id = "7">STEVE AOKI:</h2>
	<p class="hi"> He’s among the most popular EDM DJs in the world. Still, Steve Aoki’s not just sitting back and surveying his empire. He’s got where he is through application and above all, enjoyment of his work. In 2016, the Japanese-American DJ, producer and label boss is celebrating 20 years of his Dim Mak imprint, which has released everything from disco-punk to dubstep. He’s also been putting in plenty of studio time. 
Collaboration has been the name of the game, with 4OKI the banner under which he’s worked with artists including Autoerotique, Shaun Frank and Reid Stefan. In addition, Aoki’s found time to produce beats for other artists, with a notable emphasis on hook-ups with the current rap cognoscenti.

“The new collaborations I’ve been working on are coming out soon, with Lil Uzi Vert, Migos, Lil Yachty, Wale, 2 Chainz, DVBBS, Yellow Claw and more,” he shares.

Naturally, he’s been doing what he’s most famous for too, touring, playing festivals all over and caking crowds left, right and centre. Earlier this year in a DJ Mag cover feature, Aoki admitted he was over the whole confectionery trajectory lark, but also knows that it’s an expectation. “I did a couple of shows where I didn’t throw any cakes and it was awesome!” he said. “But I’m necessitating a demand. You want it, I’ll give it to you.”</p>

	<h2 id = "8">OLIVER HELDENS:</h2>
	<p class="hi">If we had to pick the DJ's DJ of EDM, few names would fit the bill better than Oliver Heldens. Someone who prides himself on creative tune selection, he's just as likely to play tech-house as he is future house and disco in an EDM set. And that's just when he's playing as Oliver Heldens. His more underground alter ego HI-LO is strictly driving tech-house and techno. “I play tech-house but I'm not a techno DJ. I play mainly house — future house,” he tells DJ Mag. “I play anything that's groovy, old house stuff or electro-house.” 

While before he felt a little out of place dropping his tunes on EDM's main stages, over the past 12 months he found himself playing slots at crossover festivals like Lollapalooza and Glastonbury, and it was as if something clicked. “Now I can rock the main stage,” he adds. “A lot of commercial stuff mixed with cool club records and it goes off, and I'm happy with that.”</p>
